0.11.1
------

- Restored XProcessInfo.kill() as alias for .terminate()
  for API compatibility.

0.11
-----------

- When tearing down processes (through ``--xkill``), the
  more polite SIGTERM is used before invoking SIGKILL,
  allowing the process to cleanly shutdown. See
  https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xprocess/issues/1
  for more details.

  XProcessInfo.kill() was unintentionally removed.
