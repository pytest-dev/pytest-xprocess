----

- #3: :method:`XProcess.ensure` now accepts preferably
  a ProcessStarter subclass to define and customize the
  process startup behavior. Passing a simple function is
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

0.11.1
------

- Restored XProcessInfo.kill() as alias for .terminate()
  for API compatibility.

-----------

- When tearing down processes (through ``--xkill``), the
  more polite SIGTERM is used before invoking SIGKILL,
  allowing the process to cleanly shutdown. See
  https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xprocess/issues/1
  for more details.

  XProcessInfo.kill() was unintentionally removed.
