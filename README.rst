`pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest>`_ plugin for managing processes
across test runs.

Setting Up
----------

To use ``pytest-xprocess`` you just need to install it via::

    pip install pytest-xprocess

and that's all!

This will provide a ``xprocess`` fixture which can be used to ensure that
external processes on which your application depends are up and running during
testing. You can also use it to start and pre-configure test-specific databases
(i.e. Postgres, Couchdb).

Additionally, there are two new command line options::

     --xkill  # terminates all external processes
     --xshow  # shows currently running processes and log files


``xprocess`` fixture usage
-----------------------------

You typically define a project-specific fixture which
uses ``xprocess`` internally:

.. code-block:: python

    # content of conftest.py

    import pytest
    from xprocess import ProcessStarter

    @pytest.fixture
    def myserver(xprocess):
        class Starter(ProcessStarter):
            pattern = "PATTERN"
            args = ['command', 'arg1', 'arg2']

        logfile = xprocess.ensure("myserver", Starter)
        conn = # create a connection or url/port info to the server
        yield conn
        xprocess.getinfo("myserver").terminate() # clean up afterwards

The ``xprocess.ensure`` method takes the name of an external process and will
make sure it is running during your testing phase. Also, you are not restricted
to having a single external process at a time, ``xprocess`` can be used to handle
multiple diferent processes or several instances of the same process.

The ``Starter`` is a subclass that gets initialized with the working
directory created for this process.  If the server has not yet been
started:

- ``args`` are used to invoke a new subprocess.

- ``pattern`` is waited for in the logfile before returning.
  It should thus match a state of your server where it is ready to
  answer queries.

- ``env`` may be defined to customize the environment in which the
  new subprocess is invoked. To inherit the main test process
  environment, leave ``env`` set to the default (``None``).

- the first 50 lines of stdout is redirected to a logfile, which is
  returned pointing to the line right after the match

If the server is already running, simply the logfile is returned.

- to extend the number of lines searched prior to considering the external
  process dead, the ``max_read_lines`` property can be set.

This expandability can be seen here.

.. code-block:: python

    class Starter(ProcessStarter):
        pattern = 'process started at .*'
        args = ['command', 'arg1']
        max_read_lines = 500

To override the wait behavior, override ``ProcessStarter.wait``.
See the ``xprocess.ProcessStarter`` interface for more details.

Note that the plugin needs to persist the process ID and logfile
information.  It does this in a sub directory of the directory
which contains a ``pytest.ini`` or ``setup.py`` file.

An important note regarding stream buffering
--------------------------------------------

There have been reports of issues with test suites hanging when users attempt
to start external python processes with ``xprocess.ensure`` method. The reason
for this is that pytest-xprocess relies on matching predefined string patterns
written to your environment standard output streams to detect when processes
start and python's `sys.stdout/sys.stderr`_ buffering ends up getting in the
way of that. A possible solution for this problem is making both streams
unbuffered by passing the ``-u`` command-line option to your process start
command or setting the ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED`` environment variable.
